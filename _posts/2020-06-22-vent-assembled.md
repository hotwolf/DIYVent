title:  Vent assembled
---

After nearly 80 hours of printing, the vent cover has been ready for assembly.
Initially I had mounted the printed cover on the wooden box that I fad built before.
The airflow was better but still not great.
The air was just circulation in the space between the cover and the fan. 
Then I built a narrower frame to move the cover closer to the fan.
I also printed four more fins for the inside of the frame, to reduce the air circulation even more

The airflow has improved, but it could be better if it had more fins that were located closer to the blades of the fan.

But for now this is my working solution.
Unfortunately, my new frame does not allow me to shut the right side window anymore

If I do a redesign of the vent cover, I'll leave out the wooden frame amn make a round fully printed shape, that fits very closely around the fan.
