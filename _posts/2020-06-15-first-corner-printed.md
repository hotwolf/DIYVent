title:  First corner printed

The first corner of the fan cover is finished. It took over 20 hours to print.

![First print (inside)]({{ site.url }}/images/2020-06-15-1st_print_inside.jpg)

The print is a bit stringy, the fins are slightly warped and when it came to the
hose connector, my printer was acting up. But overall, the print is usable.
On to the next one!
